### Exploratory Data Ananlysis
The analysis addresses key questions such as:
1. How have death rates changed over the past two decades?
2. Are there discernible differences in mortality between genders?
3. Which age groups are most affected by high death rates?
4. How do death rates vary across different districts?
5. Are there seasonal variations in death rates?
     
### Key Findings
1. Death rates have generally declined over the past two decades.
2. Female has the highest mortality rate.
3. The age groups most affected by high death rates are 80-99, followed by 60-79.
4. Death rates vary significantly across different districts. Districts 7, 9 and 11 have the highest mortality rate.
5. There are seasonal variations with higher death rates in winter.
   
### Recommendations
- Investigate and address gender-specific factors influencing mortality.
- Implement seasonal health campaigns to reduce winter-related deaths.
- Focus public health interventions on older age groups and high-mortality districts
